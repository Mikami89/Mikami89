- 👋 Hi, I’m @Mikami89 from West Africa. I am 32 years old with a military background of 10 years. I got interested into coding through freecodecamp...(a big wink for those heroes for their ninja skills ).
- 👀 I’m interested in learning programming languages and frameworks. But I do binge mangas like DNote...Shingeki no kyojin or Haikyuu.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning ReactJS.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on interesting projects for office productivity boost (productivity management....product tracking...inventory management).
- 📫 You can contact by email at meddieng13@gmail.com
